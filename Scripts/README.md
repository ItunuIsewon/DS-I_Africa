![Figure Banner](https://github.com/ItunuIsewon/DS-I_Africa_Repeats_Workshop2024/blob/main/Images/dsi-africa-workshop-banner.png)


Four Universities, Covenant University, Makerere University, the University of Cape Town (UCT), and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) are collaborating to present a two-week virtual workshop on repeat expansion detection and complex phenotypes association in Africa. This workshop is funded by the R01 DS-I Africa award number 1U01HG013442-01 and you can find more information about it at https://h3africa.org/index.php/2022/09/14/h3africa-cross-consortium-genome-analysis-of-repeat-expansions-in-wgs-data-project-spotlight/ and https://dsi-africa.org/project/28

## Course content

The workshop will last for 10 days, which is equivalent to two weeks.

### Module One – Introduction (Day 1 and 2)
+ A brief review of NGS and its technologies, genotyping, genetic variation and its types, resources, and databases for NGS
+ Bash/shell scripting, working in batch environment, job submission on HPC, installing software and tools using command line
+ NGS file format, NGS analysis tools, e.g., bcftools

### Module Two – Overview of Tandem Repeats (Day 3 and 4)
+ Description of tandem repeats, types of TRs and their characteristics, applications of TRs in health research
+ Short TRs (STRs) genotyping, tools for identifying STRs: strengths and weakness

### Module Three – STRs Analysis (Day 5 – 7)
+ Software Installation of selected tools
+ STRs identification using selected tools, at least two
+ Functional annotation of identified STRs
+ Association Analysis

### Module Four  – Hackathon (Day 8 – 10)
+ Brief description of the projects (motivation, datasets, methods, milestones, expected results, etc) – (to be done on Day 4)
+ Assigning the participants into groups and one teaching assistant per group – (to be done on Day 4)
+ Project teams start meeting up with their teaching assistants after the daily sessions as from Day 5.
+ Participants work in groups.
+ Daily review of work done to be presented by a group representative following the milestones/deliverables for each day.
+ Presentation of project outcomes and submission of project write-up
+ Announcement of hackathon results

### Invited Talks from Keynote and invited  speakers (30-minute – 1-hour slots will be created as needed during the workshop)
We expect to have invited talks from selected PhD students, Postdocs, and keynote speakers on selected topics relating to TRs identification.
Potential speakers are those who have developed tools/databases for TRs and those who have used the tools for TRs analyses, etc.
